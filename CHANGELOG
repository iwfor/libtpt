- Fixed missing std qualifiers in func_str.cxx.

Version 1.10.4
--------------
- Updated to newer version of cxxtools to get rid of "shared" warning on OS X.
- Fixed missing std:: qualificiation on some standard function calls.  This was
  specifically breaking compilation on Forte with the STLPort.

Version 1.10.3
--------------
- Fixed typo that broke @ignoreindent.

Version 1.12-beta
-----------------
- Removed ChrSet<> template and replaced with ctype calls.  Gained about 2-3%
  performance improvement.

Version 1.10.2
--------------
- Fixed Win32 projects to use proper libraries.

Version 1.11-beta
-----------------
- Added bench.cxx to test directory.  This program will time a benchmark
  template several hundred times and will be used to determine the
  effectiveness of optimizations.
- Removed private implementation from the Buffer class, yielding improved
  performance.
- Fixed possible memory leak in unhandled exception in Buffer constructor
  that creates a file stream.  (If this exception occurs, you're probably
  already in trouble since your system is out of memory!)
- Fixed memory leak in Buffer enlarge() and destructor.
- Fixed a regretable memory leak in shared_ptr<> template class for automatic
  garbage collection.  This should be the last of the memory leaks.

Version 1.10
------------
- Fixed Major bugs in lexical analyzer (hopefully last ones) causing big breaks
  in macros.
- Added test of just about everything that has been broken in macros.
- Simplified, optimized, and rewrote large chunks of the lexical analyzer,
  removing lex_impl.cxx and lex_impl.h, since the lexical analyzer really did
  not need a private implementation.  This should yield a significant
  performance improvement as well as slightly reduce the memory footprint.

Version 1.05
------------
- Fixed Major bug in lexical analyzer fixing mishandling of braces {}.  This
  bug would sometimes cause close braces to be completely ignored, completely
  breaking the flow of logical expressions or loops.

- Misc optimizations.
- Fixed a few out-of-date comments.

Version 1.04
------------
- Added @lpad and @rpad string padding functions for tabular display templates.
- Added @tpt_ignoreindent and @tpt_noignoreindent.  @ignoreindent and
  @noignoreindent are depricated.
- Added @tpt_ignoreblankline and @tpt_noignoreblankline.  @ignoreblankline and
  @noignoreblankline are depricated.
- Added new test for @lpad and @rpad.
- Updated tests to remove depricated functions.
- Updated documentation.

Version 1.03
-------------
- Added @push and @pop functions.
- Added new test for @push and @pop.
